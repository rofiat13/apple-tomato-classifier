# apple-tomato-classifier

This project aims to classify images as either apples or tomatoes using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow/Keras.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python
2. Download the dataset.
3. Run the code cells in order to train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new images.
4. Modify the code as needed for your own dataset.


## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of apples and tomatoes collected from various sources.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and dense layers for classification.

## Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using the training dataset and evaluated on the validation and test datasets. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated.

## Prediction
The trained model can be used to make predictions on new images. Simply load an image, preprocess it, and input it into the model for classification.
